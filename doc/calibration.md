# Calibration

The EEGsynth uses various control signals that have a different units and different absolute scaling. For example, MIDI values are between 0 and 127, OSC values are often (by convention) between 0 and 1, and EEG values are typically between -100 and +100 microvolt. Note that this is not only a problem for the EEGsynth, real-world modular synthesizers also use different [control voltage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CV/gate#CV) ranges.

To facilitate the interoperability between modules, we follow the convention that - whenever values are absolutely bounded between a known minimum and maximum - we scale the control values in Redis as a floating point value between 0 and 1. If another scaling is needed, e.g. for MIDI output, the control values can be read from Redis and scaled up to the desired level.

Some of the control values are not bounded, e.g. when spectral power is computed from the EEG signal. To use such control signals, they need to be calibrated and rescaled to predictable values using one of the following modules.

* [postprocessing](https://github.com/eegsynth/eegsynth/tree/master/module/postprocessing)
* [normalizecontrol](https://github.com/eegsynth/eegsynth/tree/master/module/normalizecontrol)
* [calibration](https://github.com/eegsynth/eegsynth/tree/master/module/calibration)
* [quantizer](https://github.com/eegsynth/eegsynth/tree/master/module/quantizer)

Related to this is that the [smoothing](https://github.com/eegsynth/eegsynth/tree/master/module/smoothing) module can be used to compute a smoothed version of specific control values.

## Control voltage range for external devices

### Endorphins Shuttle Control

The EEGsynth uses the [Endorphins Shuttle Control](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/endorphin-es-shuttle-control) optimally with the +/-5V pitchweel setting, which is the maximum range supported by the Shuttle Control. For more info see [this](http://www.eegsynth.org/?p=480).

Through the endorphins .ini the output control voltage can be restricted to 0-5V.

Because of the many (16) output channels, it is handy to test with both the polar and non-polar outputs, the latter mainly for the LFO/PW/ECHO modules of the Erebus.

### Erebus Dreadbox

The Erebus Dreadbox analogue synthesizer has the following specific patching specifications according to the [manual](http://www.dreadbox-fx.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/erebus_manual_v2.pdf):

```
INPUT OSC pitch: +/- 12V, 1V/oct
INPUT VCA: +/- 5V

INPUT LFO(rate): 0-5V
INPUT PW: 0-5V
INPUT Echo: 0-5V, best at 0-2.5V

OUTPUT OSC: 1V/oct, converted from MIDI if needed
OUTPUT ADSR: 0-6.6V, depending on depth setting
OUTPUT LFO: +/- 5V
```

### Arturio Microbrute

The [Microbrute](https://www.arturia.com/products/hardware-synths/microbrute/overview) has the following specifications, according to a nice article [here](http://www.hars.de/2016/01/microbrute-eurorack.html):

```
INPUT/OUTPUT OSC pitch: 0-10V, 1V/oct
OUTPUT LFO: +/- 5V
OUTPUT ADSR: 0-4.5V
```

I found no further specifications on the other input patches, i.e. Sub/PWM etc., but given that they are well-controlled by its own LFO, I would think they work well for +/-5V as well.
