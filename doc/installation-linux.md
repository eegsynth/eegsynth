# Installation instructions for Linux

NOTE: the general installation instructions using Anaconda should cover most of the installation, the notes below are older notes and probably not needed any more.

## Raspberry Pi

For Linux we are specifically targetting [Raspbian](http://www.raspbian.org), which is a free Debian-based operating system optimized for the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) hardware. This allows to build a dedicated EEGsynth on the low-cost Raspberry Pi platform.

## Installation instructions for Raspbian

Use "raspi-config" to configure the correct keyboard, time-zone, to extend the partition on the SD card and to disable the automatic start of the graphical interface upon boot.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install screen
sudo apt-get install vim
sudo apt-get install git
```

### Reconfigure the Raspberry Pi keyboard layout

The default keyboard layout is UK-English, which is probably not what you have.

```
sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-data
sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
```

## Generic installation instructions for Linux

### Package managers

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager): _A package manager or package management system is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer's operating system in a consistent manner._

The general package manager on Linux depends on the distribution you are using. Debian-based distributions (such as Ubuntu, Raspbian, Mint, etc.) use dpkg and apt-get. Redhat-based systems (such as CentOS, Fedora) use rpm and yum.

For installing Python packages there are [easy_install](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/easy_install.html) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

In the subsequent Linux installation instructions we assume apt-get and pip as the primary package managers.

### Install Redis

This is used for inter-process communication between modules.

```
sudo apt-get install redis-server
```

Redis will be automatically started on Linux. If you look for running processes, you should see

```
pi@hackpi:~ $ ps aux | grep redis
redis      434  0.4  2.0  29332  2436 ?        Ssl  10:40   0:14 /usr/bin/redis-server 127.0.0.1:6379
```

If you want to connect between different computers, you should edit /etc/redis/redis.conf and specify that it should bind to all network interfaces rather than only 127.0.0.1 (default). Edit the configuration"

```
sudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf
```

and comment out the line "bind 127.0.0.1" like this:

```
# By default Redis listens for connections from all the network interfaces
# available on the server. It is possible to listen to just one or multiple
# interfaces using the "bind" configuration directive, followed by one or
# more IP addresses.
#
# Examples:
#
# bind 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1
# bind 127.0.0.1                  ## COMMENTED OUT FOR EEGSYNTH
```

After changing the configuration file, you can kill the server, which will then restart with the correct configuration:

```
pi@raspberry:~ $ ps aux | grep redis
sudo kill -9 <ID>
```

And you should see that it restarts and binds to all interfaces:

```
pi@raspberry:~ $ ps aux | grep redis
Redis     2840  0.0  2.2  29332  2684 ?        Ssl  11:35   0:00 /usr/bin/redis-server *:6379
```

The Redis command line interface is an useful tool for monitoring and debugging the Redis server:

```
redis-cli monitor
```

### Install portmidi

This is used for MIDI communication.

```
sudo apt-get install libportmidi-dev
```

### Install dependencies for rtmidi

This is required for the python-rtmidi package further down

```
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
sudo apt-get install libjack-dev
```

### Install Python modules

For Python we are using pip as the package manager. To install pip, use the following

```
sudo apt-get install python-pip # replace with pip3 for Python 3
```

To make sure it is up to date, you should do

```
sudo pip install --upgrade pip # replace with pip3 for Python 3
```

Subsequently you can install the Python modules (replace with pip3 for Python 3).

```
sudo pip install redis
sudo pip install configparser
sudo pip install numpy
sudo pip install scipy
sudo pip install mido
sudo pip install python-rtmidi
sudo pip install pyserial
sudo pip install python-osc # for Python >= 3.6
sudo pip install pyOSC      # for Python <= 3.5
sudo pip install pyqtgraph
sudo pip install matplotlib
sudo pip install bitalino
sudo pip install rapidfuzz
sudo pip install nilearn
sudo pip install sklearn
sudo pip install neurokit
sudo pip install paho-mqtt
sudo pip install wiringpi  # only for Raspberry Pi
```

Due to the large number of non-Python dependencies, installing the scipy package is easier with apt-get than with pip.

```
sudo apt-get install python-scipy
```

### Install graphics

The plotsignal and plotcontrol modules are implemented with pyqtgraph, which uses either PyQt4, PyQt5 or PySide. This can be installed with

```
sudo apt-get install python-pyqtgraph
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5 # for Python 3
```

### Install audio

This is only needed for the software synthesizer module. Note that good quality and smooth audio output on the Raspberry Pi requires an external audio card.

```
sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio
sudo apt-get install jackd
```
