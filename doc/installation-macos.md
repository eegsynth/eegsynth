# Installation instructions for Mac macOS

NOTE: the general installation instructions using Anaconda should cover most of the installation, the notes below are older notes and probably not needed any more.

## Python

On Mac macOS there are multiple options for Python: you can either use the built-in version of Python (which is /usr/bin/python) supplied by Apple, you can install Python (and most other dependencies) through the _MacPorts_ or _HomeBrew_ package manager (see below), or you can use the _Anaconda_ Python distribution.

## Package managers

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager): _A package manager or package management system is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer's operating system in a consistent manner._

For the general software dependencies (binaries and libraries) we are using [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh). To make sure your package manager is up to date, you should do:

```
brew update
```

To make sure you have wget, you should do

```
brew install wget
```

## Install MIDO for Python

MIDO is a MIDI package that is based on portaudio.

```
brew install portmidi
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
```

## Redis

Install the Redis server and command-line client:

```
brew install redis
```

If you want to connect between different computers, you then need to edit the configuration file:

```
sudo nano /usr/local/etc/redis.conf
```

and comment out the line "bind 127.0.0.1"

You can then, either:

- configure it to launch Redis when your computer starts:

```
ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/Redis/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
```

- launch it manually:

```
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.Redis.plist
```

and then stop it later:

```
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.Redis.plist
```

## Install Python modules

For the Python dependencies (packages) we are using pip. If you have installed brew, you will probably have pip already. You can check like this

```
which pip
```

If it returns /usr/local/bin/pip, it is the version of pip (and Python) that comes with brew.

To make sure the Python package manager is up to date, you should do

```
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Subsequently you can install the Python modules

```
pip install redis
pip install configparser
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install mido
pip install python-rtmidi
pip install pyserial
pip install python-osc # for Python >= 3.6
pip install pyOSC      # for Python <= 3.5
pip install pyqtgraph
pip install matplotlib
pip install bitalino
pip install rapidfuzz
pip install nilearn
pip install sklearn
pip install neurokit
pip install paho-mqtt
```

The graphical user interfaces of plotsignal and plotcontrol are implemented with pyqtgraph, which uses either PyQt4, PyQt5 or PySide.

When using Anaconda and Python2 or Python3, the bindings between Python and Qt can be installed as follows:

```
conda install pyqtgraph
```

When using brew and Python2, the bindings between Python and Qt can be installed as follows:

```
brew tap cartr/qt4
brew tap-pin cartr/qt4
brew install cartr/qt4/pyqt
```
