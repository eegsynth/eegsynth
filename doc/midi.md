# MIDI

For the EEGsynth we are developing and testing with a variety of hardware, some of them using a MIDI interface. Furthermore, we make use of a variety of software.

## Hardware

- Novation Launch Control, Launch Control XL and Launchpad
- Korg Volca Beats, Bass and Keys
- Yamaha P-95 digital piano (keyboard)
- Arturio Microbrute
- Endorphines Shuttle Control
- USB-MIDI converter cable from Ebay

## Software and programming interfaces

The MIDI interfaces may show up differently, depending on the computer to which you connect the MIDI device, and depending on the software used on that computer.

The software interface to MIDI devices is often implemented over multiple layers. E.g. on OS X the EEGsynth modules connect with the hardware like this:

eegsynth->python->mido->portmidi->coremidi->hardware
