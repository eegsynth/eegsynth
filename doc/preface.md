# Preface

The EEGsynth is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) codebase released under the [GNU general public
license]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) that provides a real-time
interface between (open-hardware) devices for electrophysiological recordings (e.g. EEG, EMG and
ECG) and analogue and digital devices (e.g. MIDI, lights, games and analogue synthesizers). The
EEGsynth allows one to use electrical activity recorded from the brain or body to flexibly control
devices in real-time, i.e. (re)active and passive brain-computer-interfaces (BCIs), biofeedback and
neurofeedback.

The EEGsynth does *not* allow diagnostic investigations or clinical applications. It also does not
provide a graphical user interface for offline analysis. Rather, the EEGsynth is intended as a
collaborative interdisciplinary [open-source](https://opensource.com/open-source-way) and
[open-hardware](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-hardware) project that brings together
programmers, musicians, artists, neuroscientists and developers in scientific and artistic
exploration.

Although there are plans to make it more 'plug-and-play', the EEGsynth currently has to be run from
the command line, using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and
[Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29) scripts, and is therefor not friendly
for those not familiar with such an approach.

When you start an project with the EEGsynth, consider doing it together with in a group of people
that have knowledge and experience complimentary to yours, such as in electrophyiology,
neuroscience, psychology, programming, computer science or signal processing.

Since December 2018, the EEGsynth is registered as a legal _Association_ with the French
authorities.
