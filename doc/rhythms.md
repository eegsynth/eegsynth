# Rhythms

The EEGsynth can be used in a variety of ways in creating or modulating rhythms using the generateclock or heartbeat module, combined with the clockdivider, clockmultiplier and sequencer modules.

There are many interesting resources available online:

- Flash implementation of [Euclidean rhythms](https://www.hisschemoller.com/blog/2011/euclidean-rhythms/)
- [African polyrhythms](https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/polyrhythmBeatGenerator.php)
- [Code](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/49221/generating-euclidean-rhythms)) for generating the Euclidean rhythms

Some interesting hardware modules are:

- [Knight's Gallop](http://www.shakmatmodular.com/products/kg.html)

The following Python code can be used to generate a list of Euclidean rhythms that can be used in the sequencer module.
`
f=lambda n,k,a='1',b='0':n-k<2and a*k+b*(n-k)or[f(n-k,k,a+b,b),f(k,n-k,a+b,a)][2*k>n]
for n in range(1,16+1):
  for k in range(1,n+1):
    print 'e_%d_%d = %s' % (n, k, " ".join(f(n,k)))`
