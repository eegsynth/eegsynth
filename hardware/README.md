# Hardware

We have developed some custom hardware for the EEGsynth, mostly based on the Arduino and ESP-8266 plaforms.

* [Art-Net to DMX](artnet2dmx/README.md)
* [Art-Net to Neopixel](artnet2neopixel/README.md)
* [USB to CV/Gate: 1-channel version](usb2cvgate_1channel/README.md)
* [USB to CV/Gate: 4-channel version](usb2cvgate_4channel/README.md)

Furthermore, we are using the EEGsynth frequently in combination with commercial off-the-shelf hardware for which we have specific modules.

* Endorpines [Shuttle Control](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/endorphin-es-shuttle-control) USB-to-MIDI-to-CV converter
* Novation [Launchcontrol](https://global.novationmusic.com/launch/launch-control) and [Launchcontrol XL](https://global.novationmusic.com/launch/launch-control-xl) USB-to-MIDI controller
* Novation [Launchpad](https://global.novationmusic.com/launch/launchpad) and [Launchpad Mini](https://global.novationmusic.com/launch/launchpad-mini) USB-to-MIDI controller
* Korg [volca kick](http://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/volca_kick/) analog kick generator 
* Korg [volca bass](http://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/volca_bass/) analog bass machine
* Korg [volca keys](http://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/volca_keys/) analog loop synth
* Yamaha [P-95](https://usa.yamaha.com/products/musical_instruments/pianos/p_series/p-95/index.html) digital piano

We are patching the following synthesizers using analog CV/Gate signals.

* [Arturio Microbrute](https://www.arturia.com/products/hardware-synths/microbrute/overview) Analog Synthesizer
* [Erebus Dreadbox](https://www.dreadbox-fx.com/erebus/) Analog Paraphonic Synthesizer
