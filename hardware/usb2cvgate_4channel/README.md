This is a four-channel version of a CV/Gate controller. It comprises of an Arduino Nano combined with 12-bit DACs. The output voltage range is from 0 to 10V.

This hardware works well with the *outputcvgate* Python module.

The Arduino code for the firmware of this device can be found on [github](https://github.com/robertoostenveld/arduino/tree/master/eegsynth_cvgate_mcp4822).
