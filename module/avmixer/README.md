# AVmixer Module

The purpose of this module is to provide an interface to the [AVmixer software](https://neuromixer.com/products/avmixer).

AVmixer incorporates a MIDI interface which can pick up software MIDI messages from other software running on the same computer. The MIDI settings pannel allows the mapping of the incoming MIDI messages onto software functions. It allows three presets for different MIDI interfaces.

AVmixer can also be controlled using the TouchOSC app, which sends OSC messages that are translated by the [TouchOSC MIDI bridge](http://hexler.net/docs/touchosc-configuration-connections-bridge) into software MIDI commands. AVmixer includes a TouchOSC template layout that is configured to work out of the box with the factory configured presets "3".

You can control the AVmixer software both (and simultaneously) from this EEGsynth module and from the TouchOSC interface.
