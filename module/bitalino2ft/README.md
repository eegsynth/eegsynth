# bitalino2ft

The purpose of this module is to read real-time data from the Bitalino device and to write it to the FieldTrip buffer. Other modules can read it from the buffer and analyze/convert/process it.

This code is based on [this Python example](https://pypi.org/project/bitalino/#description). Prior to using this module, you may want to test your device with the [OpenSignals (r)evolution](http://bitalino.com/en/software) application.

# Requirements

The FieldTrip buffer should be running prior to starting this module.
