# Generatetrigger module

This module generates triggers at specific intervals. The frequency of the triggers (i.e the expected length of the interval) and the randomness of the intervals can be controlled.

The [generateclock](../generateclock/) module is an alternative, which generates triggers with a very precise timing. The [processtrigger](../processtrigger/) module can be used to further process the trigger and to assign values to each trigger.
