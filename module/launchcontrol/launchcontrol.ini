[button]
; this is a list of MIDI messages that are to be specifically processed as button presses, i.e. using pubsub rather than setget
;
; push buttons are momentary, i.e. only "on" while you keep them depressed
; toggle buttons retain their state after you release them, pressing once more switches to the next state
; toggle1 buttons switch between on-off
; toggle2 buttons switch between on1-on2-off
; toggle3 buttons switch between on1-on2-on3-off
; toggle4 buttons switch between on1-on2-on3-on4-off
