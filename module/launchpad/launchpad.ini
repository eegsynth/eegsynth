[button]
; this is a list of MIDI messages that are to be specifically processed as button presses, i.e. using pubsub rather than setget
; the second row is 41,42,43,44,57,58,59,60
; the bottom row is 73,74,75,76,89,90,91,92
;
; push buttons are momentary, i.e. only "on" while you keep them depressed
; toggle buttons retain their state after you release them, pressing once more switches to the next state
; toggle1 buttons switch between on-off
; toggle2 buttons switch between on1-on2-off
; toggle3 buttons switch between on1-on2-on3-off
; toggle4 buttons switch between on1-on2-on3-on4-off

[scale]
; it is preferred to use floating point control values between 0 and 1
; because MIDI note values are between 0 and 127, we scale by 1/127
