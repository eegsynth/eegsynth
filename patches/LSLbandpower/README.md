# EEG harmonics

This is a patch intended to transform power in different frequency bands into harmonics, such as with the Verbos Harmonic Oscillator. Formally the 'harmonics' patch, this one is updated to the use of LSL (tested for the Mentalab Explore), and the output of both MIDI (Endorphines Cargo) and OSC (for use with Max and Pure Data)
