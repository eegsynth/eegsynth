This patch is used for the presentation of Cogito in Space at the InScience Film Festival in 
Nijmegen from 6-10 November 2019.

This is a small patch for plotsignal (with some additional modules for testing) to visualize the 
data from the 32-channel GTec Nautilus headset on the windows computer, while the EEG is being 
processed and sonified on the Raspberry Pi using the "Acces-s" patch.
