# Off Off

Robert met with Jeff Weber on 22 October 2025 at the Art Cinema [Off Off](https://offoff.be/en/) in Ghent, Belgium, to experiment with the modulation of movies using EEG.

The patch is designed to be used with either an 8-channel Unicorn EEG system, or a 32-channel Gtec Nautilus EEG system. The occipital alpha band activity is used to control a video processing patch that runs in TouchDesigner.
